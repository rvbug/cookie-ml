# Introduction

If you want to start a new DS or ML project or ready to move to productionise the code from Jupyter notebook, then you can use this cookie-ml to create your own custom folders

Run the following command

**`$ make help`**  - shows the lists of commands you can execute

If you already know about makefile or just want to create the folder directly
**`make install`**



But if you would like to know more about **make** and **Makefile** visit my blog :-
