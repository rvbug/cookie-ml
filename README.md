# Introduction

All ML projects start with basic understanding of data and experiement with Jupyter notebook (mostly) and then gradually moving to a proper IDE, writing/reusing helper functions, seperating data_pipline code with data processing etc. It is chaotic for beginners but that is the beauty of it.


# About this project

I use a specific ML project structure. It helps me focus on getting started immediately on any project. It contains a simple python script and a configurable folder structure in YAML format.
This is extemely simple to use command line script.


# Project directories

The project structure is quite simple actually
