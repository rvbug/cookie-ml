# Introduction

You have trained your model and seems to be pretty satisfied. This could be in a `jupyter notebook` or `vscode` or `pycharm`.

While it is the time to move your code into production, there is a need for a struture and order of your project. 




Run the following command

**`$ make help`**  - shows the lists of commands you can execute

If you already know about makefile or just want to create the folder directly
**`make install`**



But if you would like to know more about **make** and **Makefile** visit my blog :-
